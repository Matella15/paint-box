## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to broadcast messages between sprites.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

##### Club leader Resources

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/63473366/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ PaintBox.sb2

##### Project Resources

For this project, club members can make use of external resources that aren't available in the Scratch library:

+ eraser.svg.

Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

For club members that aren't able to access these project resources, there is a Scratch project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/paint-resources](http://jumpto.cc/paint-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

+ PaintBoxResources.sb2 

## Learning Objectives
+ Importing images;
+ Relational and boolean operators (`>`{:class="blockoperators"} & `and`{:class="blockoperators"});
+ Broadcasting between sprites.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Shortcuts" - Using `key press`{:class="blocksensing"} events to broadcast messages;
+ "More pens" - Adding more pen colours, to consolidate the learning of broadcasting messages.

## Frequently Asked Questions
+ Changes in a sprite's 'costume center' isn't registered until another tab is clicked. Children should click on another costume, or on the 'Scripts' tab to finalise changes to the costume center.
+ The crosshair for the pencil must be placed **just below** the tip of the pencil, not on the tip of the pencil. If the crosshair is on the pencil then Scratch just thinks you are moving the sprite around in the editor. If the pencil doesn't draw correctly then the crosshair has probably been placed on the tip of the pencil (which does seem logical) and needs to be moved just below the pencil.
